#### Space Pirates

 Space Pirates is a Godot Multiplayer Game located in space where main game loop is inspired by MOBA genre games. My thought is to have two motherships that has some health and that are shielded. Players are splitted to two teams and theyre job is to collect rare orbs located in space and in the mean time fight other team members. These orbs can be traded with player's Mothership for credits that can provide upgrades. Each player has chosen its Spaceship category at the beginning and this category has its own Upgrade Tree.

Upgrade Trees are meant to help whole Team and are important to finish match. Atleast on Upgrade Category will have as final Upgrade some kind of Nuclear bomb that will disable enemy's Mothership Shield, which will make this Mothership vulnerable to hit.

After this stage team has to work together to destroy enemy Mothership, which will mean end of the Match.
